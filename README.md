# Slicing Design: Joey Figma Portfolio Template

This repository showcases the process of converting the **Joey Figma Portfolio Template** into fully functional code. The goal of this project was to take the visual design provided in Figma and implement it into a responsive and clean front-end code structure using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

## Overview

The **Joey Figma Portfolio Template** is a sleek, modern design aimed at creating a professional-looking portfolio. In this project, I meticulously sliced each design element from Figma and translated it into responsive code, ensuring that the final product closely matches the original design while being optimized for web performance.

### Features:
- **Pixel-perfect implementation**: The layout and design are crafted with high attention to detail, ensuring the website looks as intended across various devices and resolutions.
- **Responsive design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes including desktop and mobile.
- **Smooth animations and interactions**: Integrated subtle animations for an enhanced user experience, staying true to the modern aesthetic of the Joey template.
- **Clean code structure**: Organized and easy-to-read code, following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
